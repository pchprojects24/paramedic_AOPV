      <span>Defibrillation</span>
      <span class="accordion-icon" aria-hidden="true">+</span>
    </button>
    <div class="accordion-content">
      <div class="accordion-content-inner">
        <p><strong>Step-by-step defibrillation procedure:</strong></p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Prepare the patient:</strong> Ensure the patient is in cardiac arrest with a shockable rhythm (ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia). Apply multifunction defibrillation pads to the patient's bare chest—one on the upper right chest and one on the lower left lateral chest. Keep ECG monitoring active.</li>
          <li><strong>Select defibrillation mode:</strong> Press the <strong>Defib</strong> key on the device. Ensure <strong>Sync</strong> mode is OFF (for defibrillation of VF/pulseless VT).</li>
          <li><strong>Select energy level:</strong> Use the selector knob to choose the appropriate energy level (typically 120-200 Joules for biphasic, follow your protocols). The selected energy will display on screen.</li>
          <li><strong>Charge the device:</strong> Press the <strong>Charge</strong> button (on the device or the pads). The device will emit an audible tone when fully charged.</li>
          <li><strong>Clear the patient:</strong> Loudly announce "CLEAR" and perform a visual sweep to ensure no one is touching the patient, bed, or any conductive equipment.</li>
          <li><strong>Deliver shock:</strong> Press the <strong>Shock</strong> button firmly (on the device or both buttons on the pads simultaneously). The device will deliver the shock.</li>
          <li><strong>Post-shock:</strong> Immediately resume CPR starting with chest compressions. Reassess the rhythm after 2 minutes of CPR or per your resuscitation protocol. Repeat defibrillation if the shockable rhythm persists.</li>
        </ol>
        <p><strong>Important safety notes:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Never touch the patient during shock delivery.</li>
          <li>Ensure the patient is on a non-conductive surface if possible.</li>
          <li>Remove any medication patches from the chest and dry the skin before applying pads.</li>
          <li>Follow your local cardiac arrest protocols for energy dosing and sequence.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <!-- Cardioversion -->
  <div class="accordion-item">
    <button class="accordion-header" aria-expanded="false" type="button">
      <span>Synchronized Cardioversion</span>
      <span class="accordion-icon" aria-hidden="true">+</span>
    </button>
    <div class="accordion-content">
      <div class="accordion-content-inner">
        <p><strong>Step-by-step cardioversion procedure:</strong></p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Patient preparation:</strong> Cardioversion is used for unstable tachycardias with a pulse (e.g., atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, SVT, or stable VT). If possible, sedate the patient per protocol. Apply multifunction pads to the patient's bare chest (anterolateral or anteroposterior position). Ensure continuous ECG monitoring is active with a clear tracing.</li>
          <li><strong>Select cardioversion mode:</strong> Press the <strong>Defib</strong> key, then enable <strong>Sync</strong> mode. The device will display sync markers (usually small dots or arrows) on the ECG trace at each R wave.</li>
          <li><strong>Confirm sync markers:</strong> Verify that the sync markers appear consistently on each QRS complex (R wave). If markers are not appearing correctly, adjust the ECG gain or lead selection until they are clearly visible.</li>
          <li><strong>Select energy level:</strong> Use the selector knob to choose the appropriate starting energy based on the rhythm and your protocols (e.g., 50-100 J for atrial flutter, 120-200 J for atrial fibrillation).</li>
          <li><strong>Charge and deliver:</strong> Press <strong>Charge</strong>. Once charged, announce "CLEAR" and ensure no one is touching the patient. Press the <strong>Shock</strong> button. The device will deliver the shock synchronized to the next R wave.</li>
          <li><strong>Post-cardioversion:</strong> Immediately reassess the patient's rhythm and vital signs. If the arrhythmia persists, consider increasing energy and delivering another synchronized shock per protocol. Note that Sync mode may automatically turn OFF after shock delivery—re-enable it for subsequent shocks.</li>
        </ol>
        <p><strong>Key differences from defibrillation:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Sync mode must be ON</strong> for cardioversion to avoid delivering a shock on the T wave (which could induce VF).</li>
          <li>Cardioversion is used for patients <strong>with a pulse</strong>; defibrillation is for pulseless arrest.</li>
          <li>Lower energy levels are typically used initially for cardioversion compared to defibrillation.</li>
          <li>The device will wait to deliver the shock on the R wave, which may cause a brief delay after pressing the shock button.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <!-- Pacing -->
  <div class="accordion-item">
    <button class="accordion-header" aria-expanded="false" type="button">
      <span>Pacing</span>
      <span class="accordion-icon" aria-hidden="true">+</span>
    </button>
    <div class="accordion-content">
      <div class="accordion-content-inner">
        <p><strong>Step-by-step pacing procedure:</strong></p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Patient preparation:</strong> Transcutaneous pacing is used for symptomatic bradycardia unresponsive to medications. Apply multifunction pads to the patient's bare chest (anterolateral or anteroposterior position). If the patient is conscious, explain the procedure and consider analgesia/sedation per protocol, as pacing can be uncomfortable.</li>
          <li><strong>Enter pacing mode:</strong> Press the <strong>Pacer</strong> key on the device. The pacing screen will appear.</li>
          <li><strong>Select pacing mode:</strong> Choose between <strong>Demand</strong> mode (pacing occurs only when the patient's intrinsic rate falls below the set rate) or <strong>Fixed</strong> mode (pacing occurs at the set rate regardless of intrinsic rhythm). Demand mode is typically preferred.</li>
          <li><strong>Set the pacing rate:</strong> Use the selector knob to set the desired heart rate (typically 60-80 bpm for adults, adjust based on patient needs and protocols).</li>
          <li><strong>Set the output current (mA):</strong> Start with a low current (e.g., 30-40 mA) and prepare to increase. This determines the strength of the electrical impulse.</li>
          <li><strong>Start pacing:</strong> Press <strong>Start Pacing</strong>. The device will begin delivering pacing impulses, visible as vertical lines (pacer spikes) on the ECG trace.</li>
          <li><strong>Increase current to achieve capture:</strong> Gradually increase the current (mA) while watching the ECG for electrical and mechanical capture:
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Electrical capture:</strong> Each pacer spike should be followed by a wide QRS complex.</li>
              <li><strong>Mechanical capture:</strong> Confirm by palpating a pulse synchronous with the paced rhythm or observing the patient's blood pressure.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Set final current:</strong> Once capture is achieved, increase the current by an additional 10 mA above the capture threshold to ensure consistent capture. This is the operating current.</li>
          <li><strong>Monitor the patient:</strong> Continuously monitor ECG, vital signs (especially blood pressure), and patient comfort. Adjust sedation as needed. Watch for loss of capture.</li>
          <li><strong>Stop pacing:</strong> To discontinue pacing, press <strong>Stop Pacing</strong>. Monitor the patient's intrinsic rhythm closely after stopping.</li>
        </ol>
        <p><strong>Troubleshooting pacing issues:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>No capture:</strong> Increase the current (mA). Check pad placement and contact with the skin. Consider changing pad position (try anteroposterior).</li>
          <li><strong>Patient discomfort:</strong> Pacing causes muscle contractions that can be painful. Provide analgesia/sedation per protocol. Reassure the patient.</li>
          <li><strong>Intermittent capture:</strong> Ensure pads are making good contact. Increase current slightly. Check for patient movement or poor pad adhesion.</li>
        </ul>

    <button class="accordion-header" aria-expanded="false" type="button">
      <span>Troubleshooting</span>
      <span class="accordion-icon" aria-hidden="true">+</span>
    </button>
    <div class="accordion-content">
      <div class="accordion-content-inner">
        <h3>No ECG Trace or Poor Signal</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Verify all ECG lead cables are properly connected to the device and securely attached to the patient's electrodes.</li>
          <li>Check electrode contact with the skin—replace electrodes if dry, expired, or not adhering well.</li>
          <li>Try changing the selected lead (e.g., switch from Lead II to Lead III) to find a clearer signal.</li>
          <li>Increase waveform size using the Size key and adjust brightness for better visibility.</li>
          <li>Ensure the patient's skin is clean, dry, and free of excessive hair (clip or shave if necessary).</li>
          <li>Check for electrical interference from other devices—move away from sources of artifact.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>NIBP Reading Failed or Inaccurate</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Verify the cuff is the correct size for the patient (bladder should cover 80% of arm circumference).</li>
          <li>Check cuff placement—center the bladder over the brachial artery with the marking at proper position.</li>
          <li>Ensure the limb is at heart level and the patient is still during the reading (movement causes errors).</li>
          <li>Allow the cuff to fully deflate before attempting another reading.</li>
          <li>Check for kinked tubing or disconnected hoses between the cuff and the device.</li>
          <li>Try the other arm if readings continue to fail.</li>
          <li>For very low or high blood pressures, the device may struggle—consider manual BP if needed.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>SpO₂ Reading Unavailable or Unreliable</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Ensure the SpO₂ sensor is properly positioned on the finger, toe, or earlobe with good contact.</li>
          <li>Check for patient movement, shivering, or poor perfusion (cold extremities)—try a different site.</li>
          <li>Verify the sensor is clean and dry; remove nail polish if using a finger sensor.</li>
          <li>Replace the sensor if it appears damaged, contaminated, or is giving consistently poor readings.</li>
          <li>Check the sensor cable connection to the device.</li>
          <li>Consider alternate monitoring sites (earlobe, bridge of nose) in cases of poor peripheral perfusion.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>EtCO₂ Reading Issues</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Check that the sampling line is properly connected to the device and the airway adapter.</li>
          <li>Verify there are no kinks, obstructions, or moisture in the sampling line.</li>
          <li>Replace the sampling line or airway adapter if contaminated with secretions or water.</li>
          <li>Ensure the patient has adequate ventilation—very low respiratory rates may affect readings.</li>
          <li>Check that the CO₂ sensor is not expired or contaminated.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Battery Low or Power Issues</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Swap in a charged battery pack immediately—always keep two batteries installed for redundancy.</li>
          <li>Connect the device to AC/DC power whenever available to preserve battery life.</li>
          <li>During equipment checks, test battery status and charge spare batteries using the approved charger.</li>
          <li>If the device powers off unexpectedly, check battery contacts for corrosion or damage.</li>
          <li>Keep batteries at room temperature; extreme cold or heat reduces battery performance.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Device Not Charging or Delivering Shock</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Verify multifunction pads are properly applied to the patient's skin with good adhesion.</li>
          <li>Check pad connections to the device—ensure they are fully seated in the port.</li>
          <li>Confirm pads are not expired (check the expiration date on the package).</li>
          <li>If the device fails to charge, check battery status and AC/DC power connection.</li>
          <li>Ensure you are in the correct mode (Defib vs. Sync) for the intended therapy.</li>
          <li>If the device displays an error message, consult the operator's manual or contact technical support.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Alarm Fatigue or Nuisance Alarms</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Review alarm limits to ensure they are appropriately set for the patient's condition—avoid overly narrow limits.</li>
          <li>Adjust alarm sensitivity if the device offers this option.</li>
          <li>Ensure good signal quality (ECG, SpO₂) to reduce false alarms from artifact.</li>
          <li>Never disable alarms entirely—adjust limits instead to reduce nuisance alarms while maintaining safety.</li>
        </ul>
