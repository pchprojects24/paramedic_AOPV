<h1>Vaccine Administration Procedures</h1>
<p class="scope-block">Step-by-step procedures for safe vaccine administration. Always confirm that a primary immunizer has authorized the immunization before proceeding.</p>

<h2>Pre-Immunization Steps</h2>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Verify authorization:</strong> Confirm the primary immunizer has prescribed the vaccine(s) or that a valid medical directive/standing order covers this immunization.</li>
  <li><strong>Screen the patient:</strong> Review the pre-immunization checklist — ask about allergies (especially to egg, latex, or vaccine components), current illness, pregnancy, immunosuppression, and history of adverse reactions to vaccines.</li>
  <li><strong>Obtain informed consent:</strong> Explain what vaccine is being given, common side effects, and when to seek medical attention. Document consent.</li>
  <li><strong>Review the CF 2034:</strong> Check the member's immunization record for previous doses, intervals, and any outstanding vaccines.</li>
  <li><strong>Verify the vaccine:</strong> Confirm correct product, lot number, expiry date, and that the cold chain has been maintained. Inspect for discolouration, particulates, or damage.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Injection Technique — Intramuscular (IM)</h2>
<p>Most CAF vaccines are given IM. The preferred site for adults is the <strong>deltoid muscle</strong>.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Position the patient seated with the arm relaxed at their side.</li>
  <li>Identify the deltoid: thickest part of the muscle, approximately 2–3 finger-widths below the acromion process.</li>
  <li>Clean the site with an alcohol swab and allow to air-dry.</li>
  <li>Use a 22–25 gauge needle, 25 mm (1 inch) for most adults. Use 38 mm (1.5 inch) for larger patients or deeper muscle mass.</li>
  <li>Insert the needle at a 90-degree angle to the skin in a quick, dart-like motion.</li>
  <li>Aspirating before injection is <strong>not recommended</strong> for IM vaccine administration (per current NACI/WHO guidance).</li>
  <li>Inject the vaccine at a steady rate.</li>
  <li>Withdraw the needle and apply light pressure with a dry swab. Apply an adhesive bandage.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Injection Technique — Subcutaneous (SC)</h2>
<p>Some live vaccines (e.g., MMR, varicella) are given SC.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Preferred site: posterior aspect of the upper arm (triceps area) or anterolateral thigh.</li>
  <li>Use a 25–27 gauge needle, 16 mm (⅝ inch).</li>
  <li>Pinch a fold of skin and insert the needle at a 45-degree angle.</li>
  <li>Inject slowly, withdraw, and apply light pressure.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Multiple Vaccines at One Visit</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Different vaccines can be given at the same visit using <strong>different injection sites</strong>.</li>
  <li>If two IM injections are given in the same limb, separate the sites by at least 2.5 cm (1 inch).</li>
  <li>Document the specific site used for each vaccine (e.g., "left deltoid" vs. "right deltoid").</li>
  <li>Live injectable vaccines not given on the same day should be separated by at least 28 days.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Post-Immunization</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Instruct the patient to remain in the observation area for a <strong>minimum of 15 minutes</strong> (30 minutes if history of allergic reactions or receiving a new vaccine).</li>
  <li>Advise on common side effects: soreness at the injection site, mild fever, fatigue — typically resolving within 24–48 hours.</li>
  <li>Counsel to seek medical attention for: persistent high fever, difficulty breathing, widespread rash, or swelling of the face/throat.</li>
  <li>Complete all documentation: CF 2034, CFHIS entry, lot number, site, route, dose, date, and immunizer identity.</li>
  <li>Dispose of sharps in the sharps container immediately — never recap needles.</li>
</ol>
