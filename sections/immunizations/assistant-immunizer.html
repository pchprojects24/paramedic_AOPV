<h1>Becoming an Assistant Immunizer</h1>
<p class="scope-block">In the CAF immunization framework, paramedics (Med Techs) operate as <strong>assistant immunizers</strong>. Primary immunizers — physicians, physician assistants, and nurse practitioners — prescribe and authorize vaccines. Assistant immunizers administer vaccines under that authority.</p>

<h2>Immunizer Levels</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Primary Immunizer:</strong> A clinician (Medical Officer, Physician Assistant, or Nurse Practitioner) who independently assesses the patient, determines which vaccines are indicated, prescribes the immunization, and may administer it themselves. They hold full scope for vaccine decision-making.</li>
  <li><strong>Assistant Immunizer:</strong> A qualified medical technician who administers vaccines <em>under the direction of a primary immunizer</em>. The primary immunizer must have assessed the patient or authorized the immunization via a standing order or medical directive before the assistant immunizer can proceed.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Current qualification as a CAF Medical Technician (Med Tech) — QL3 qualified or equivalent.</li>
  <li>Current Basic Life Support (BLS/CPR-HCP) certification.</li>
  <li>Completion of the CF H Svcs Gp Assistant Immunizer training module (distance learning + practical).</li>
  <li>Successful completion of the written competency evaluation.</li>
  <li>Practical skills assessment witnessed and signed off by a primary immunizer.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Training Content</h2>
<p>The assistant immunizer course covers:</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Vaccine immunology basics:</strong> How vaccines work, types of vaccines (live attenuated, inactivated, subunit, mRNA, toxoid), and herd immunity concepts.</li>
  <li><strong>CAF immunization schedules:</strong> Routine and deployment-specific vaccine requirements; reading and interpreting the CF 2034.</li>
  <li><strong>Vaccine storage and cold chain:</strong> Proper handling, temperature monitoring, and what to do when the cold chain is broken.</li>
  <li><strong>Consent and screening:</strong> Confirming informed consent, reviewing contraindications and precautions, and completing pre-immunization checklists.</li>
  <li><strong>Injection technique:</strong> Intramuscular (IM) and subcutaneous (SC) administration, site selection (deltoid, vastus lateralis), needle gauge and length, and multi-vaccine administration at one visit.</li>
  <li><strong>Documentation:</strong> Recording lot numbers, site, route, dose, date, and immunizer identity in the CF 2034 and CFHIS.</li>
  <li><strong>Adverse event recognition and management:</strong> Identifying and managing local reactions, vasovagal syncope, and anaphylaxis; AEFI reporting requirements.</li>
  <li><strong>Anaphylaxis management:</strong> Recognition, epinephrine administration, and post-event monitoring. Every immunization session must have anaphylaxis supplies immediately available.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Scope of Practice — What You Can and Cannot Do</h2>
<h3>As an Assistant Immunizer, You CAN:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Administer vaccines that have been prescribed or authorized by a primary immunizer.</li>
  <li>Screen patients using the pre-immunization checklist for contraindications.</li>
  <li>Prepare and draw up vaccines according to product monograph instructions.</li>
  <li>Provide standard post-immunization counselling (wait 15 minutes, common side effects, when to seek care).</li>
  <li>Manage immediate adverse events including anaphylaxis (epinephrine, call for help, BLS).</li>
  <li>Document all immunizations and adverse events.</li>
</ul>
<h3>As an Assistant Immunizer, You CANNOT:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Independently decide which vaccines a patient needs — this requires a primary immunizer's assessment or a medical directive/standing order.</li>
  <li>Override a contraindication identified on screening — defer to the primary immunizer.</li>
  <li>Administer vaccines not covered by your unit's medical directive or the primary immunizer's order.</li>
  <li>Sign as the authorizing immunizer on the CF 2034 — only the primary immunizer signs that block.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Maintaining Qualification</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Annual refresher training (usually an online module) must be completed to remain current.</li>
  <li>Participate in at least one immunization clinic annually to maintain practical proficiency.</li>
  <li>Maintain current BLS certification at all times.</li>
  <li>Keep a log of immunizations administered for professional development records.</li>
  <li>If qualification lapses, a re-certification practical assessment with a primary immunizer is required before resuming immunization duties.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Immunization Clinic Setup Checklist</h2>
<p>Before any immunization session, the assistant immunizer should confirm:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Primary immunizer is available (on-site or reachable) and has authorized the immunizations.</li>
  <li>Anaphylaxis kit is present and stocked: epinephrine auto-injectors (or ampoules + syringes), airway adjuncts, and oxygen.</li>
  <li>Vaccines are within expiry and have been stored at correct temperature (2–8 &deg;C); check fridge log.</li>
  <li>Supplies on hand: appropriate needles, syringes, alcohol swabs, sharps container, adhesive bandages.</li>
  <li>Documentation materials ready: CF 2034 cards, CFHIS access or paper forms, lot number stickers.</li>
  <li>Post-immunization observation area with seating and a timer (15-minute minimum wait).</li>
</ul>
