<h1>Cold Chain &amp; Vaccine Storage</h1>
<p class="scope-block">Maintaining the cold chain is critical to vaccine efficacy. Shipboard environments present unique challenges — vibration, power interruptions, and limited resupply.</p>

<h2>Temperature Requirements</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Standard vaccines:</strong> Store at +2 &deg;C to +8 &deg;C. This includes most inactivated, subunit, and toxoid vaccines.</li>
  <li><strong>Frozen vaccines (if carried):</strong> Some live vaccines (e.g., varicella, certain formulations) may require &minus;15 &deg;C or colder. Confirm product monograph.</li>
  <li><strong>Never freeze</strong> vaccines that are meant to be refrigerated — freezing destroys adjuvant-containing vaccines (Hep B, Tdap, HPV, etc.).</li>
  <li><strong>Diluents:</strong> Store at room temperature or refrigerated per product monograph. Never freeze diluents.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Daily Fridge Monitoring</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Check min/max thermometer twice daily (morning and end of day) and record readings on the fridge temperature log.</li>
  <li>If temperature has gone outside 2–8 &deg;C range, <strong>do not administer</strong> affected vaccines. Quarantine them (mark "DO NOT USE") and contact the primary immunizer and pharmacy for a cold chain break assessment.</li>
  <li>Reset min/max thermometer after each reading.</li>
  <li>Ensure the fridge is a purpose-built pharmaceutical/vaccine fridge if available — not a bar fridge or domestic unit.</li>
  <li>Do not store food, drinks, or lab specimens in the vaccine fridge.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Cold Chain Break Procedures</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Immediately quarantine all affected vaccines — place in a separate, clearly marked container still within the fridge.</li>
  <li>Record the date, time, duration of the break, and observed temperature range.</li>
  <li>Contact CF H Svcs Gp pharmacy or the vaccine manufacturer for guidance on whether the product remains viable.</li>
  <li>Do not discard vaccines until directed — some products tolerate brief excursions.</li>
  <li>Document the event, the decision made, and the disposition of each affected lot.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Shipboard Considerations</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Secure the fridge to prevent movement in heavy seas; ensure the door latch is reliable.</li>
  <li>Connect the fridge to an uninterruptible power source or the ship's essential services circuit.</li>
  <li>Carry a battery-operated data logger as a backup to the built-in thermometer.</li>
  <li>When receiving vaccine resupply alongside, inspect packaging for cold-chain indicators (temperature strips, cold packs) and reject deliveries that show evidence of temperature excursion.</li>
  <li>For transport between ship and shore clinic, use a validated insulated container with conditioned ice packs. Do not place vaccines directly against ice packs (risk of freezing).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Stock Management</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Rotate stock using first-expiry-first-out (FEFO).</li>
  <li>Check expiry dates monthly and remove expired products.</li>
  <li>Keep an inventory log showing vaccine name, lot number, quantity, expiry date, and date received.</li>
  <li>Coordinate resupply with the shore-side clinic or pharmacy well before stock runs low — account for sailing schedules and port availability.</li>
</ul>
